Hi, this is a simple program that two players can use to play the game rock, paper, scissors. Each of the players picks a unique item(a rock, paper or scissors) 
that are matched against the item randomly generated by the program.The game rules don't change (rock beats scissors and is beaten by paper that's beaten by scissors) but the winner 
is determined by who beats or draws with the computer. Player who loses to computer, loses the game.
